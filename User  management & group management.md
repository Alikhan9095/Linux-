# User Management(useradd,userdel,passwd,usermod,chage.lastlog)
--------------------

## Useradd or adduser command
 - `sudo useradd username`'adduser' is a more user-friendly, higher-level command. It's actually a Perl script that makes use of useradd in the background but simplifies the process for you.
 - `sudo useradd -m username` 'useradd' is a basic, lower-level command for adding users. It doesn't perform many automatic steps,must manually configure certain things like creating the home directory.
    To create a home directory, you need to explicitly specify the -m option.
